The building seems to have been in existence by the late eighteenth century and measured roughly 14.5 metres east-west by 5.5 metres north-south. It appears to have been a two-storey stone rubble building with a pitched roof (Bantock, 1996) and may have been constructed as a barn. However, an Ordnance Survey plan published in the 1950s records the structure as a pound. The building survived into the 1950s but was subsequently demolished.\nThe site of the building now lies largely beneath the entrance road to a warehouse on the west side of Cater Road."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadocktestorg/query-test-data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

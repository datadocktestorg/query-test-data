The tenement (Structure 1) was of late-twelfth or early thirteenth-century date and was archaeologically excavated in 1982 [BUAD 467]. It was a stone-founded and comprised two ranges, one fronting on to the east side of Redcliff Street and the other to the rear. Within the building was a hearth of pitched Pennant sandstone slabs [603A].\nThe building was probably destroyed by the development of No.70, Redcliff Street."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadocktestorg/query-test-data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

Peter and Paul, located on the western side of Pembroke Road, Clifton. The cathedral was commissioned in 1965 to replace the Pro-Cathedral in Park Place. The building was constructed between 1969 and 1973 to a design by Ronald Weeks, Frederick S. Jennett and Antoni Poremba of Percy Thomas Partnership by John Laing Construction Ltd. It was intended to accommodate 900 worshippers and adopted an elongated hexagonal plan with a series of lead-covered pitched roofs. It is constructed of pre-cast concrete panels and in-situ concrete with an imprinted finish from the timber shuttering. There are entrances at first-floor level off Pembroke Road (St. Peter's Door) and Clifton Park (St. Paul's Door and the West Door to its south). The entrance doors open on to an ambulatory space around the north, west and south sides of the building with the sanctuary and high altar located on the east side. The altar is of Portland stone with the lectern, designed by the architects and made by William Mitchell, on its north side. To the south of the sanctuary is the choir and the organ, by the Austrian company Rieger Orgelbau. The narthex on the north side of the building, adjacent to St. Peter's Door, is lit by two stained glass windows designed by Henry Haig, that on the north-west side being titled \"Pentecost\" and that on the north, \"Jubilation\". On its south-west side is the Blessed Sacrament Chapel while on the east is the Baptistery with a font by Simon Verity carved from Purbeck marble and supported on a base of Portland stone decorated with carved interlocking doves. The inscription \"ONCE YOU WERE NO PEOPLE BUT NOW YOU ARE GOD'S PEOPLE\" (First letter of St. Peter 2:10) runs around the rim of the font. On the north-west side of the West Door is the Lady Chapel. Relief panels in concrete designed and made by William Mitchell, depicting the Stations of the Cross are set in the wall of the ambulatory and run in an anti-clockwise direction from the south-east side. Two brass plaques setting out the history of the Mission to Bristol and the South-West which were brought from the Pro-Cathedral in Park Place are fixed to the west wall of the ambulatory. Beneath the building is a room for public use, the Apostle Room.\nSome 16 metres to the south of the cathedral (at ST 57294 73547) is the presbtery, Cathedral House, a three-storey building with a plinth of concrete blocks and the upper storeys of roughcast concrete. There is an external stair tower at the centre of its south side.\nThe building has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/2/10054)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadocktestorg/query-test-data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building was a house of probable seventeenth-century date which lay on the north side of Rosemary Street. The building appears to have been built as a one of a terrace of four and was a one window range house of two storeys plus attic with a gabled roof. The entrance on the ground floor was on the east side of the frontage. The building shared a lateral rubble stack with No.18. The building was demolished for the development of the Broadmead shopping centre, probably in the winter of 1954-1955.\nThe remains of the building are likely to be fairly well-preserved below ground."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadocktestorg/query-test-data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

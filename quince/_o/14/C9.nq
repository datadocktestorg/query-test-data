The building appears from documentary evidence to have been constructed in the mid eighteenth century (Bryant 2000) but it is first recorded cartographically by a map of the area produced by Sturges in 1817. In 1825 a Mrs Barnes was living at Redland Hall (BRO P/HTW/V2(a)). By the time of the Westbury tithe survey Redland Hall was owned by Hugh Vaughan.\nRedland Bank and Redland House were listed Grade III but were removed in 1961 for the construction of new educational buildings."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadocktestorg/query-test-data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The row of four gabled houses stood on the north side of Host Street, No.34 being at the east corner of Host Street abd Steep Street. The buildings were all four-storey, single-bay jettied houses with front gables. They had bay windows at first and second floor level, and smaller sashes in the gable ends. The roofs were pantiled.\nThe buildings appear to have been erected contemporaneously as part of the same development. They were demolished in the later part of the nineteenth-century."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadocktestorg/query-test-data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

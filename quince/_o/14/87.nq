The construction date of the building is unknown but it was in existence by the time of the Brislington tithe survey of 1846. This indicates that it stood immediately to the north of a large pond (SMR 3319), on an island of land between two watercourses leading from the north-east and north-west corners of the pond. The building had been demolished by the early 1880s. The function of the structure is not clear but it may have originated as a water mill.\nThe site of the building now lies in the gardens to the rear of Nos.2-4 West Town Grove."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadocktestorg/query-test-data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
